# Microcenter-Web-Scrape

Hi, this is a web scrape project that I created to look through the catalog of microcenter (a store that I often shop at).
This is also my first python project ever so I am still learning the ins and outs of the language, please feel free to let me know of any improvements you may have\

## Instructions
* Run the input file, which will prompt you to input a microcenter URL. You can copy and paste here
* The program then runs the `setup.py` file to install the necessary pip packages in the offically supported way
* The program does the scraping with the `scraper.py` file
* Final output is in `results.csv`
