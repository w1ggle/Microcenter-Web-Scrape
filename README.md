# Microcenter 2-in-1 Laptop Web Scraper
# CHECK LAST PUSH FOR DATE. FEEL FREE TO PULL REQUEST TO UPDATE THE OUTPUT

Hi, this is a web scrape project that I created to look through the catalog of microcenter (a store that I often shop at). The store often has deals or inventory that is not on the floor and can only be found online. Thus I am trying to create a project that can automate something that would normally take me an hour before I head to microcenter.

This is also my first python project ever so I am still learning the ins and outs of the language, please feel free to let me know of any improvements you may have!

## Instructions
* Run `py setup.py` first to install the necessary packages
* Then run `py scraper.py`, which will check microcenter for 2-in-1 laptops have have 6+ cpu cores
* Final output is in `output.csv`
