# Microcenter-Web-Scrape

Hi, this is a web scrape project that I created to look through the catalog of microcenter (a store that I often shop at). The store often has deals or inventory that is not on the floor and can only be found online. Thus I am trying to create a project that can automate something that would normally take me an hour before I head to microcenter.

This is also my first python project ever so I am still learning the ins and outs of the language, please feel free to let me know of any improvements you may have!

## Instructions
* Run the file with `py scraper.py `, which will check microcenter for 2-in-1 laptops have have 4+ cpu cores
* The program then runs the `setup.py` file to install the necessary pip packages in the officially supported way
* The program continues the scraping with the `scraper.py` file
* Final output is in `output.csv`
